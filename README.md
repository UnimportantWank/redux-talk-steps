You can view the development process step-by-step by looking at the [commit log](https://github.com/zacacollier/redux-talk-steps/commits/master).

This example was built using `create-react-app` and based on an excellent introduction to Redux by [Toran Billups](https://vimeo.com/151603293).

I've also posted detailed write-ups to accompany this Repo on [Medium](https://medium.com/@zacharycollier). Check them out and let me know what you think.
